# Ground-Control-TRMNL

Small API that get's data from the international space station

I wrote this small app to make an endpoint for my (TRMNL)[https://usetrmnl.com/] app (still in progress).
It uses the Datastreamer from the ISS and was heavily inspired by the (ISS mimic project)[https://iss-mimic.github.io/Mimic/]
